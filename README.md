# DrillMap
A responsive, resizable Android app which accepts 2 sets of start and end points (in the form of coordinates/area names, or marker) and then plots them on a Google Map. Next, find the shortest path which connects all four points and display that on the same map. Also build an activity that displays the logs of all the previously computed routes.Added voice input as well.
